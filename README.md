<h2>GEO App</h2>

GEO App is a MERN stack application that allows one to maintain a list of preferred restaurants, sort of as a personal bookmark manager for resturants. Its core functionality is that of adding/removing/updating restaurants to the list. All restaurants are composed of the following fields:

- name
- description
- rating (a number from 1 to 5)
- location

The GEO App API is a REST API which helps maintain the list of the restaurants in a mongo db database. Built on top of express and mongo db, the GEO App API allows any client application (such as the Geo App Front-end for example) to submit and retrieve data as needed.
